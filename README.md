This is my Flutter Android and iOS mobile app.
It is an application that helps a little radio station reach its multiple users and alerts them on things happening
The application is not completely done as a few details haven't been addressed.

to run this application, open the lib folder inside the **vision** folder and run the main.dart file
In VScode, use the command **flutter run** to execute it 
In Android Studio, click Run / the play sign
