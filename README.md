This is my Flutter Andriod and IoS mobile app.
It is an application that helps a little radio station reach its multiple users and alerts them on things happening
The application is not completely done as a few details haven't been addressed.
to run this application, open the lib folder and run the main file
In VScode, use the command flutter run to execute it
